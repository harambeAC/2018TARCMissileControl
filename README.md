# 2018TARCMissileControl
Missile Guidance System With Arduino, MPU6050, 2 Servos for 2018/2019 TARC

Usage:
Upload onto an Arduino through arduino softwater

Total waste of an arduino if this is what is being sent 800 ft above the air.
This code is should probably be going into an smaller IC which will then be soldered onto a THT board along with the MPU
